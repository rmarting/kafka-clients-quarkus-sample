      # When a producer sets acks to "all" (or "-1"), min.insync.replicas specifies the minimum number of replicas that
      # must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful.
      # When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical
      # scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and
      # produce with acks of "all". This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a
      # majority of replicas do not receive a write.
